# This is Depreciated!
I haven't updated this in forever, mainly because I couldn't get the GUI to work the way I wanted but also it's a bit naff. Luckily though, MohammedGamer85 has created [Mythtic](https://github.com/MohammedGamer85/Mythtic/releases) which does everything this did, and everything it could never do, but better so use that. Thank you

## Not working? This may be it!
This program is Python based and requires Python to be installed to run. The compiled executable, however, does not need Python installed to run

If you choose to run the Python script, it uses the 'request' library. This is not installed by default and so must be installed manually. To do so, press win+r to open the run dialogue and then type in `powershell` and press enter. Within powershell type `pip install request`. If it responds

`ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement request (from versions: none)`

`ERROR: No matching distribution found for request`

then it is already installed and you should open an issue so I can try and help

### What is Legend's Wardrobe?
Legend's Wardrobe is a Python based program which imports heroes created by [Miclee](https://github.com/Miclee7)

#### So what can it do right now?
Currently, it can install 2 different Heroes. [Miclee Hero](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft-legends/mods/miclee-skin) and [Jeb_ Hero](https://github.com/LegendsModding/Jeb-Hero/tree/Hero), both by [Miclee](https://github.com/Miclee7)

#### So what's coming in the future?
Nothing, sorry. Look at [Mythtic](https://github.com/MohammedGamer85/Mythtic/releases) it's much better

#### Can I help?
For the most part, I'm trying to make this a solo journey. I'm quite new to programming and I'm hoping this can expand my knowledge. If you have any ideas or issues absolutely be sure to let me know, no matter how small
