# Not working? This may be it!
This program is Python based and requires Python to be installed to run. The compiled executable, however, does not need Python installed to run

If you choose to run the Python script, uses the 'request' library. This is not installed by default and so must be installed manually. To do so, press win+r to open the run dialogue and then type in `powershell` and press enter. Within powershell type `pip install request`. If it responds

`ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement request (from versions: none)`

`ERROR: No matching distribution found for request`

then it is already installed and you should open an issue so I can try and help

## What is Legend's Wardrobe?
Legend's Wardrobe is a Python based program which imports heroes created by [Miclee](https://github.com/Miclee7)

### So what can it do right now?
Currently, it can install 2 different Heroes. [Miclee Hero](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft-legends/mods/miclee-skin) and [Jeb_ Hero](https://github.com/LegendsModding/Jeb-Hero/tree/Hero), both by [Miclee](https://github.com/Miclee7)

### So what's comming in the future?
There's a lot planned but here's what's coming in order of most likely to happen to least:
1. More templates
2. ~~GUI~~
3. Import downloaded heroes
4. Import your own skins
5. In app hero mod creator/packager
6. Import your own models
7. In app texture editor
8. In app model editor (incredibly unlikely)

### Can I help?
For the most part, I'm trying to make this a solo journey. I'm quite new to programming and I'm hoping this can expand my knowledge. If you have any ideas or issues absolutely be sure to let me know, no matter how small
