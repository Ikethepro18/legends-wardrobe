## What is Legend's Wardrobe?
Legend's Wardrobe is a Python based program which imports hero templates created by [Miclee](https://github.com/Miclee7)

### So what can it do right now?
Currently, Miclee has only released 1 template, and as such is the only one currently available for install, so this is more of a proof of concept at the moment

### So what's comming in the future?
There's a lot planned but here's what's coming in order of most likely to happen to least:
1. More templates
2. GUI
3. Import your own skins
4. Import your own models
5. In app texture editor
6. In app model editor (incredibly unlikely)

### Can I help?
For the most part, I'm trying to make this a solo journey. I'm quite new to programming and I'm hoping this can expand my knowledge. If you have any ideas or issues absolutely be sure to let me know, no matter how small
